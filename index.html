                  Club Scene is a collective run by Rochelle Oh and myself. It started out as a magazine, but has extended to a podcast, and screen printed t-shirts,  and we have aspirations for plenty more. This first issue of the Magazine, is ‘Vessel’. We explored all perceptions of this term and what they might mean through the public’s input and creative contributions from talented local artists, writers and designers. The magazine acts as an archive for the wide range of responses, presented on newspaper material. 
                  This is the typeface and logo I designed for the Identity, as well as a couple of exerts from the issue.

                  This project aims to encourage youths to be more engaged in their local communities / city councils and be conscious of their role in the environment. This is a platform in the form of a website that acts as a youth ‘hub’ for secondary students. It will provide a spectrum of opportunities, ideas, experiences and workshops that are current, and go beyond the boundaries of school. 
                  It acts as an outlet for youths participate and collaborate with projects, events and ideas and meet others with similar interests within their local areas. It should be regarded to youths as a safe and welcoming space for participation and collaboration.

                  This project evolved from challenging the boundaries of digitally printed typography, but also embracing the restrictions it has maintained through receipts and ephemera such as movie tickets, theatre tickets, and transportation passes. These items are intended for temporary use, yet some gain value through collecting and treasuring, while others play into the throwaway culture. Through scanning, enlarging and analysing a range of these printed items came the nature of fast printing; the common glitches such as pixelated curves, misprinted shapes, dotted textures and blurred lines. This became the inspiration for the Docket typeface.

                  One of Fashion Revolution’s campaigns encouraged people to question where their clothes come from and who they are made by. There are currently many unethical and underpaid working conditions in many places around the world, therefore informing consumers of the footprint of their clothes is a good first step to transparency in fashion. 
                  The typographic style was inspired by that of rallies and protests and newspaper typography, providing a ‘news title’ aesthetic, with both old school morphed serif and sans serif fonts. 
                  Given its size and shape and size, it has many forms and uses. The user is free to take their own spin and express of their own individual fashion styles. By giving multiple uses to an item, this concept also allows and encourages sustainability in fashion.
