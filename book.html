      Greetings notified ones ↓ <br> <br> 
      Welcome to the first edition of NetNotify, the Newsletter for Network Professionals. The primary goal of NetNotify is simple: to provide timely information on cool new products and services in the networking industry. 
  
Have you ever spoken with one of your associates and heard about a great seminar they went to for free but you never heard a word about it until it was over? Or, have you missed out on promotions for free products from vendors because you just didn’t hear in time? Well, judging by the hundreds of new subscriptions that we’ve been processing each day, I’ll assume that many of you know exactly what I am talking about. That is precisely why I started NetNotify.

NetNotify is a publication that will be growing and improving on a regular basis. As a service for the network professional, we are interested to hear what you have to say. When there are issues you would like to see addressed in future editions, be sure to let us know! 
Future editions will only list new products, services or patches released within that publishing period. Within this edition though, there are several items that date back to the early part of April due to a backlog of some items waiting to be published. This will be the only time that issues older than 2 weeks will be addressed in NetNotify.
